# Switch Input To English
A [KeePass v2.x](https://keepass.info/) plugin to auto switch input language to english when trigger auto-type.

## Purpose
In some multi-language / non-english language Windows environment (like Chinese / Japanese user), when using the global auto-type hot key, it will lead to incorrect input when input language is not english in foreground window.

## Usage
Just add the English-Unites States to input language list in the Setting / Time & Language page of Windows.
Notice: this plugin is in the early development, so the behavior is not determined if there is no English-Unites States in the input language list of Windows.
(the option interface for choosing the input language of auto-type will be provide in the future.)

## Installation

Just download the SwitchInputToEnglish.plgx file (see files above or click here), copy it to the KeePass application plugin directory and restart KeePass.
